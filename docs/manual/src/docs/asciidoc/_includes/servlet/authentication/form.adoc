[[form]]
= Form Login
You might be wondering where the login form came from when you were prompted to log in, since we made no mention of any HTML files or JSPs.
Since Spring Security's default configuration does not explicitly set a URL for the login page, Spring Security generates one automatically, based on the features that are enabled and using standard values for the URL which processes the submitted login, the default target URL the user will be sent to after logging in and so on.

While the automatically generated log in page is convenient to get up and running quickly, most applications will want to provide their own log in page.
To do so we can update our configuration as seen below:


[source,java]
----
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
		.authorizeRequests()
			.anyRequest().authenticated()
			.and()
		.formLogin()
			.loginPage("/login") // <1>
			.permitAll();        // <2>
}
----

<1> The updated configuration specifies the location of the log in page.
<2> We must grant all users (i.e. unauthenticated users) access to our log in page.
The `formLogin().permitAll()` method allows granting access to all users for all URLs associated with form based log in.

An example log in page implemented with JSPs for our current configuration can be seen below:

NOTE: The login page below represents our current configuration.
We could easily update our configuration if some of the defaults do not meet our needs.

[source,html]
----
<c:url value="/login" var="loginUrl"/>
<form action="${loginUrl}" method="post">       <1>
	<c:if test="${param.error != null}">        <2>
		<p>
			Invalid username and password.
		</p>
	</c:if>
	<c:if test="${param.logout != null}">       <3>
		<p>
			You have been logged out.
		</p>
	</c:if>
	<p>
		<label for="username">Username</label>
		<input type="text" id="username" name="username"/>	<4>
	</p>
	<p>
		<label for="password">Password</label>
		<input type="password" id="password" name="password"/>	<5>
	</p>
	<input type="hidden"                        <6>
		name="${_csrf.parameterName}"
		value="${_csrf.token}"/>
	<button type="submit" class="btn">Log in</button>
</form>
----

<1> A POST to the `/login` URL will attempt to authenticate the user
<2> If the query parameter `error` exists, authentication was attempted and failed
<3> If the query parameter `logout` exists, the user was successfully logged out
<4> The username must be present as the HTTP parameter named __username__
<5> The password must be present as the HTTP parameter named __password__
<6> We must <<csrf-include-csrf-token>> To learn more read the <<csrf>> section of the reference
