= HTTP Basic

If you want to use basic authentication instead of form login, then change the configuration to

[source,xml]
----
<http use-expressions="false">
<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER" />
<http-basic />
</http>
----

Basic authentication will then take precedence and will be used to prompt for a login when a user attempts to access a protected resource.
Form login is still available in this configuration if you wish to use it, for example through a login form embedded in another web page.
