In this section we will discuss the minimum setup in how to use Spring Security with Spring Boot.

== Updating Dependencies

The only necessary step is to update the dependencies using <<getting-maven-boot,Maven>> or <<getting-gradle-boot,Gradle>>.

[[servlet-hello-boot-auto-configuration]]
== Spring Boot Auto Configuration

Spring Boot will automatically

* Enable Spring Security's default configuration which creates a Servlet `Filter` as a Bean named `springSecurityFilterChain` which is responsible for all the security (protecting the application URLs, validating submitted username and passwords, redirecting to the log in form, etc) within your application.
* Create a `UserDetailsService` Bean with a username of `user` and a randomly generated password that is logged to the console
* Register the `Filter` with Bean name `springSecurityFilterChain` with the Servlet container for every request.

Spring Boot isn't configuring much, but it does a lot.
You can find a summary of the features below:

* Require an authenticated user for any interaction with the application
* Generate a default login form for you
* Allow the user with the *Username* _user_ and the *Password* that is logged to the console to authenticate with form based authentication
* Protects the password storage with BCrypt
* Allow the user to logout
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CSRF attack] prevention
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation[Session Fixation] protection
* Security Header integration
